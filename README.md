# Data Structures Implementation in Various Languages

This project demonstrates the implementation of core data structures in multiple programming languages: **Python**, **Java**, **C++**, and **JavaScript**. It provides a comparison of syntax, memory handling, and performance nuances across languages.

## Data Structures Covered

1. **Arrays**: Static and dynamic array implementations.
2. **Trees**: Binary trees and binary search trees, covering traversal techniques.


## Structure
Each data structure includes:
- Basic operations: Insertion, deletion, traversal
- Complexity analysis
- Language-specific considerations

This project is a reference for understanding and comparing data structure implementations in popular languages.
